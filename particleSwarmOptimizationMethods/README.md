# Particle Swarm Optimization
Implements three different forms of particle swarm optimization for solving optimization problems of 
the general form 

    min f(x,y)=min f(x) or max f(x,y) = max f(x) where y are inputs with known values
     x          x           x            x

with arbitrary constraints. The versions of particle swarm optimization are
  1) Standard particle swarm optimization (PSO)
  2) Constricted particle swarm optimization (GCPSO)
  3) Non-parameteric particle swarm optimization. 
All of these methods are explained in detail in
